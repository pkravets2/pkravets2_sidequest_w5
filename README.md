## Description

This sketch creates a calm, meditative top-down world larger than the screen using smooth camera follow, gentle movement, and subtle pacing effects with comfort toggles.

Use acceleration/friction movement with consistent diagonal speed and slow-walk precision.

Design three mood areas with shape/color-only visuals and subtle ambient motion.
